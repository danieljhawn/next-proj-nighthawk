## Project Nighthawk

This project was formed out of a need for an easy to use estimating system.
Due to the unique nature of each print job estimates must be calculated on a per job basis, this results in a good portion of the day being devoted to telling clients how much their sticker job might cost.

Project Nighthawk aims to inform clients of approximately how much a given sticker might cost them, as well as tracking previous quotes for easy reference!

## Technologies used

 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Next is a great framework that simplifies the creation of APIs and makes deployment a breeze!
 - React
 - react-bootstrap
 - bcrypt
 - Sequelize

## Areas of Expansion

In the future we would like to add more functionality such as an Admin panel that allows employees to make changes that we wouldn't want the client making themselves.
